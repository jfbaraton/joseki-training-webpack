A joseki is a variation that gives an equitable result for both players. In other words, a joseki is fair to both players. A player should of course prefer a variation that gives a favorable result, but be satisfied with joseki in the context of whole-board strategy.

Choosing a joseki:
Since josekis work effectively in a certain direction, examine positions at adjacent corners and sides before choosing a joseki.

The opposite corner matters only if a ladder is involved. Some guidelines:
1. Have support for a fight. A high position provides support; a low position does not.
2. Take the side with most value.
2a. A juncture point for both sides is of great value.
2b. A side where making territory is uncertain is of little value.
3. Consider strategic balance.
4. Get sente if there are more big points on the board.
5. If there are two variations with similar outcome, but one with a ladder and one without, avoid the ladder, because you don't need to risk an opponent's ladder breaker.

How to learn joseki:
If you don't know joseki or a specific joseki, which you want to learn, don't try to remember every single variation you find here. Look first at the joseki. Then try to remember the easiest variations. When you learn a joseki, look also for the follow-ups in the middle and end game.

If something goes wrong or you want to know more, look up variations, special strategies, trick plays and mistakes. To understand why variations are only for special situations, or are always mistakes, compare their results with the results of joseki (instead of looking at their results in isolation).

3-3 Point = San-San = Sam-Sam = San-San
---------------------------------------------

The san-san (3-3) point, emphasizing territory at the expense
of influence (especially following an approach at 'a').

All joseki for the 3-3 point are relatively simple.

White approaches are 'a' to 'c'. White 'b' to 'e' are played
when the top side is favored (such as an extension).

Kata-tsuki (shoulder hit)
--------------------------

The shoulder-hit is the traditional answer to the 3-3.

The direction of Black 3 depends on the positions on the side.

Crawling once may be the premise for a follow-up move of sliding with a knight's move in the opposite direction. If Black plays 3 at 'a' (to the right), the follow-on knight's move is then played at the top. Black's knight's move reduces territory potential on the side it is played.

Given a White stone at top, White 2 would be a mistake. In such a case, White should have played an extension from that stone, rather than White 2.

Black joseki continues with 'a'. Black 'b' and 'c' (both very rare) show a special strategy.

For variations of Black playing elsewhere, see 4-4 point (Hoshi) variations.

Black 'a' and 'b' favor the top, while Black 'c' (and 'd') emphasize the right side (to the potential sacrifice of giving White thickness at the top).

Black 'e' and 'f' are not recommended.

5-3 Point = Mokuhazushi = Waemok = Waimu
---------------------------------------------------

The mokuhazushi (5-3) point was popular in the Edo period in Japan (1600 - 1867). It emphasizes influence. Territorially, it is inferior to the 3-4 point.

Approach moves for White range from 'a', 'b' or 'c'. White 'a' is typical.

After 'a', the 5-3 point can lead to different complicated joseki: the taisha and the near low pincer. Both can be avoided or simplified.

White 'b' forfeits the corner, and emphasizes the right side, so locally this is disadvantageous for White.

White 'c' leads to a division of profit for White and influence for Black. A ladder helps when playing White 'c'.

White 'd' is played by amateurs who don't know 3,5-point-joseki and professionals in situations where an equal result in this corner is unimportant. 'd' is inferior to 'a', 'b' and 'c'.

White 'e' can be played as part of center-moyo-strategy, but is not joseki, but more like playing a reduction after tenuki once.

After White plays tenuki 'f', Black can choose between two shimari and a trick play.

Komoku Kakari
-----------------

White 2 is the standard approach because of its solidity and
stability.

Black replies with 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'

Black 'd' is strategically correct, if there is a Black stone
on the triangled, a White stone on the squared point.

The most difficult of all joseki is the taisha 'i'. Once Black has played this move, he has only one inferior move to simplify. So, if he doesn't know the '1000 variations', he may well choose one of the five pincers, who are much easier. But if he knows them and White does not, White need not fear Black 'i', because he still has several opportunities to avoid the complex variations with an equal or well acceptable result.
'e' is the most complicated of the five pincers, you may well learn it at least. White can simplify.

'k' is a mistake.

The aim of playing the close pincer of Black 3 is mainly to build influence on the right. Therefore a Black position in the lower right corner is desirable when making this pincer.

White replies range from 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' or 'e'. White 'a' is most popular. The other moves indicate a special strategy.

White cannot play elsewhere, as Black 'a' gives White a very unfavorable result.

White 'e' is the simplifying variation. It gives a secure corner territory for influence and sente. It isn't considers joseki, because, White gets completely surrounded.
