A joseki is a variation that gives an equitable result for both players. In other words, a joseki is fair to both players. A player should of course prefer a variation that gives a favorable result, but be satisfied with joseki in the context of whole-board strategy.

Choosing a joseki:
Since josekis work effectively in a certain direction, examine positions at adjacent corners and sides before choosing a joseki.

The opposite corner matters only if a ladder is involved. Some guidelines:
1. Have support for a fight. A high position provides support; a low position does not.
2. Take the side with most value.
2a. A juncture point for both sides is of great value.
2b. A side where making territory is uncertain is of little value.
3. Consider strategic balance.
4. Get sente if there are more big points on the board.
5. If there are two variations with similar outcome, but one with a ladder and one without, avoid the ladder, because you don't need to risk an opponent's ladder breaker.

How to learn joseki:
If you don't know joseki or a specific joseki, which you want to learn, don't try to remember every single variation you find here. Look first at the joseki. Then try to remember the easiest variations. When you learn a joseki, look also for the follow-ups in the middle and end game.

If something goes wrong or you want to know more, look up variations, special strategies, trick plays and mistakes. To understand why variations are only for special situations, or are always mistakes, compare their results with the results of joseki (instead of looking at their results in isolation).

---------------------------------------------------------

The star or hoshi (4-4) point, emphasizing influence at the potential expense of territory.

The first experiments with the star point were around 1840 in Japan; its first appearances in pro games date to the early 1900's.
Its rise to preeminence came during the 'New Fuseki' movement in Japan in the mid-1930's.

White approaches with 'a', 'b', 'c' or 'd'. White 'a' is the standard approach move. The variations after it cover the great majority of hoshi joseki. Other approaches invite a local loss, but may make sense strategically.

'e' covers White playing elsewhere. These variations show White approaches when there are multiple Black stones locally.

'f' shows the too early sansan invasion (which is not joseki).

'g' shows a splitting move (esp. when Black has already played at the top).

'h' is feasible if strategically sensible.

'i' is a move on the side preparing to approach from the other side.

'j', 'k' and 'l' are covered in another branching.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

White 2 is the standard approach move to the 4-4.

Black joseki responses range from 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'm' or 'n'.

The variations after 'a' and 'b' should be studied together to understand similarities and differences.

'c' leads to much more complications than the other answers, but White can simplify.

'd' is called Tsuke-Nobi-Joseki. Its shape also occurs on the side without corner. Kyu and low dan players should totally avoid playing this variation, regard it as bad move and instead play an extension (a - c) or a pincer.

Black needs the ladder for 'e'. An additional stone on  n  is also very helpful.

'f' is not generally favorable for Black, nor joseki. 'f' is better than 'i', if there's a Black stone on the triangled point.

'j', 'k' and 'l' show special strategies based upon the fuseki.

'o' shows Black ignoring the approach move (White 2) and invasion into different extensions and moyos based on the Hoshi.

'p' shows the greedy play of using the star point immediately for territory.

'q' is possible if White is not on the top side.

'r' is a trick play.

's' is covered in two other branches.

Black 3, the two-space low pincer, at best indicates a special strategy.

The two-space low pincer is not as forceful as the one-space pincer, nor as relaxed as the three-space pincer, which is most often used as a dual purpose move to pincer and extend at the same time. Neither fish nor fowl, the two-space low pincer is less able to secure territory compared to the one-space pincer, if the selected variation comes to that, and perhaps more likely to later come under attack if White establishes a base for White 2.

White continues with 'a' to 'c'.

'd' continues on the right side against a Black komoku. This variation explains when Black 3 can be applied.

Black continuations shown are 'a' to 'f'.
'a' = 3-10 extension.
'b' = large knight extension.
'c' = small knight extension.
'd' = high double wing formation.
'e' is possible, but not joseki. 'e' is shown to illustrate White invasions.
'f' demonstrates joseki in the ni-ren-sei and san-ren-sei fuseki.
'g' and 'h' show the correct answer to a kakari with an additional Black stone there.
